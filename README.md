# Analysis-Of-Maze-Generation-Algorithms

## Overview
This project explores three introductory 2-D maze generation algorithms: Depth-First Search (DFS), Recursive Description, and Prim’s Method. The focus is on addressing their inherent drawbacks to enhance player engagement in game development. The algorithms are implemented to generate intricate mazes that can be utilized in various gaming scenarios.

## Features
- Generates mazes using three different algorithms.
- Visualizes the maze generation process.
- Provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm.
- Allows customization of maze parameters.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KVSGVinayak11/Analysis-Of-Maze-Generation-Algorithms
   cd Analysis-Of-Maze-Generation-Algorithms
   ```

2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To generate a maze, run the following command:
```bash
python src/generate_maze.py
```
You can customize the maze parameters in the script as needed.

## Algorithms

### Depth-First Search (DFS)
The DFS algorithm starts at a random cell and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. This method creates long, winding paths and is effective for generating complex mazes.

### Recursive Description
This algorithm uses a recursive approach to visit each unvisited neighbor, carving paths by removing walls. It continues until all cells have been visited, resulting in a fully connected maze.

### Prim’s Method
Prim’s algorithm generates a maze by starting with a grid full of walls and progressively adding passages. It ensures that the maze remains connected while creating a more structured layout compared to DFS.

## Testing
To run the tests for the algorithms, navigate to the `tests` directory and execute:
```bash
python -m unittest discover
```
Make sure to have the necessary test cases implemented in the `tests` folder.

## Examples
Example mazes generated by the algorithms can be found in the `examples` directory. Each example includes a visual representation of the maze and the algorithm used to generate it.
